					<p>SAOTA, a leading firm of architects is driven by the dynamic combination of Stefan Antoni, Philip Olmesdahl, Greg Truen, Phillippe Fouché and Mark Bullivant who share a potent vision easily distinguished in their design.</p>
					<p>This, paired with both an innovative and dedicated approach to the design, documentation and execution of projects globally, has seen SAOTA become an internationally sought-after brand.</p>
					<p>SAOTA has a global footprint with projects on 6 continents. We have a clear understanding of the place of design in the world and how to deliver architectural projects in diverse markets.</p>
					<p>This success is driven by a design philosophy that connects function and form, and the pursuit of true architectural design to create appropriate solutions. The focus on achieving maximum value has also led to global invitations to design, build and create highly prestigious projects.</p>
					<p>The philosophy of practice is embodied in the spirit of enquiry that flourishes amongst its staff. This spirit not only guides the firm, but enables it to maintain its position as definitive designers in a highly competitive and fast-changing industry. Increased exposure to the global marketplace has seen SAOTA flourish as cities and contexts allow for infinite inspiration which can be seen radiating from the approach to design.</p>
					<p>SAOTA is also focused on using the most current computer technology in its design process, both to understand the design and to communicate the design to our clients. To this end we are world leaders in the use of Revit and have also developed virtual reality tools for use in our process.</p>
					<p><em>We strive to promote a service marked by excellence both in our buildings and in addressing the needs of our clients, with the focus on high standards &amp; elegance…</em></p>

					<h3>Design</h3>
					<p>
					The architectural designers are highly skilled and experienced, which allows schemes to be conceptualised in dynamic, yet legible presentations. This allows the design process to develop swiftly with the precise method of achieving objectives and testing the solutions comprehensively. SAOTA have done a substantial amount of projects abroad and have skills in achieving the project requirements set. The design architects are backed up by an advanced computer aided drawing office capable of detailed 3D analysis and presentation.
					</p>
					<h3>Technical</h3>
					<p>
					The office has developed advanced technical skills related to, i) Construction Detailing, ii) Building Services and iii) Contract Administration of projects. Further in working on projects abroad the office has had experience with multi- disciplinary project teams made up of consultants from companies from various countries.

					<h3>Systems</h3>
					<p>
					SAOTA have developed advanced systems for co-ordination of the projects across all 5 Stages of the architect’s service. This ensures that client presentations, design reviews, Technical Documentation, Tendering and Contract Administration are managed to the highest quality standards. SAOTA has adopted the NCS (National CAD Standard) as developed by the American National Institute of Building Sciences. This greatly simplifies the exchange of building design and construction data between the members of the team by standardising the formatting of electronic data.</p>
					<p>
					SAOTA has also converted to REVIT, the leading Building Information Modelling (BIM) software available. Allowing us to develop and document a building in a 3 dimensional environment. Any changes are immediately co-ordinated through the entire documentation package. It also gives us unprecedented control over the coordination of structure and services when working with consultants using the same platform.
